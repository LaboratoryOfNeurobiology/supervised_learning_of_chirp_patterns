# Supervised Learning of Chirp Patterns

Technical details of the method: [Lehotzky and Zupanc, 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/)

## Overview

Folder "GT_raw_data" contains time-frequency-amplitude recording segments used for manual collection of ground truth (GT) samples of chirps.

Folder "GT_processed_data" contains the all chirps manually collected from each recording segment (files named "test_#_processed_chirp_rev.mat"). It also contains the processed (centered, normalized, trimmed) version of chirps for each recording segment (files named "trimmed_#.mat") calculated using "process_GT_samples.m".

Folder "recordings_TfA_data" contains all time-frequency-amplitude recordings from urethane treatment and handling "recovery" experiments.

Folder "results" contains all other results generated by "detect_*.m" and "eval_TFSB.m".

For description of individual Matlab scripts see docstring inside scripts.
